                    h2 What is it?
                    p At the beginning of this project, we all worked in the support department at an online employment website. From time to time, clients would have setups that involved "scraping" their website to get job data to post on our company's site. This was a process we all became familiar with troubleshooting and resolving.
                    p This project is basically the same principal. <a href="deals.kinja.com/" class="link-def">Kinja Deals</a> is a website that aggregates deals from across the web and posts them on their site. Our goal is to collect that product/price data and present it in a logical, sortable, manipulatable way. Further along in our project maturity, we hope to have historical data to display our data in a creative way.
